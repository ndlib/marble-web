  "description": "The Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame is home to a noteworthy collection of photographs, perhaps the finest academic collection in the Midwest. Although the 19th century collection is renowned, the 20th century collection is equally significant but lesser known. This portfolio are highlights from the exhibition of the same name on view at the Snite Museum of Art from August 11, 2020 – February 27, 2021 in the O’Shaughnessy Galleries.\n\nAmong this survey are iconic works by Alfred Stieglitz and Lewis Wickes Hine at the dawn of the century, as well as photographs by Sally Mann and John Baldessari in is final decades. In the academic setting, the photographs have been chosen to exemplify major developments in visual culture, historical events, and the stylistic and technical evolution of photography. This dynamic century–marked by two world wars, aesthetic and news pictures, and humans on the Moon–is preserved in the collective memory in photographic images.",

In the mid-1920s, she wanted to expand beyond her rarified clientele and took her camera to the country in upstate New York. Later she befriended the Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Julia Mood Peterkin. When visiting Peterkin at her plantation, Lang Syne, in South Carolina, Ulmann had the chance to photograph the farm workers, who lived much as their enslaved forebears. Yet Ulmann’s images also represent sociability, generosity, and repose. This is one of several of Ulmann’s Lang Syne images that present her subject’s occupation as integral to her personality. A woman of dignity and accomplishment, she shares community responsibilities. Ulmann published her photographs, along with a selection of Peterkin’s writing about African American life, in Roll, Jordan, Roll, named for the eighteenth-century Anglican hymn embraced by the African American community.",

She became an assistant to Man Ray, who helped refine her technical expertise and introduced her to many artists. Among them was Eugène Atget, who photographed Paris as it changed over his lifetime. When Abbott returned to New York after eight years in France, she found the city much changed. She photographed the transformation of New York, as Atget had recorded the evolution of Paris. For this image Abbott stood with her back to the Hudson River to photograph a row of old buildings warming in the afternoon sun. What seems at first to be a static architectural view teems with life on close inspection. Delivery vehicles represent the transformation of business in Tribeca as an officer directs traffic. Today, this street has become the West Side Highway, with six busy lanes of speeding traffic.",

In 1880 he took up photography and the fashionable gum-bichromate technique. It enabled him to combine photographic imagery with hand drawing to give images a sketchy, expressive quality. “If a man slavishly copies nature,” Demachy wrote, “no matter if it is with hand and pencil or through a photographic lens, he may be a supreme artist all the while, but that particular work of his cannot be called a work of art.” For Plains of Holland Demachy used a negative he made in the Netherlands. Working from his image, he drew on a sheet of writing paper with a mixture of watery ink, gum arabic, and light-sensitive potassium dichromate. When the sheet was exposed in contact with his negative, the gum hardened in proportion to the amount of light received. When the sheet was washed, an image of tinted gum was left where the artist had drawn.",

In the late 1890s, he made watercolors and oil paintings in a luminous style inspired by Impressionism and the work of James McNeill Whistler. He experimented with visual effects of different colors in several versions of the moon rising through a screen of trees. This photograph is one of them, made on Long Island in summer 1904. To explore color effects in his photographs, Steichen printed this image in platinum, then superimposed layers of colored gum from the same negative on the same sheet. He achieved a similar effect in this enlarged photogravure, made sixty years later, by directing the intaglio printer to ink and wipe the plate with black, blue, and green inks. One of Steichen’s few surviving Moonrise paintings of the 1910s is now in the Snite Museum collection and on view on the second floor.",

Stieglitz took this photograph on a voyage to Germany aboard the S.S. Kaiser Wilhelm II. It is a view from the exclusive promenade deck down into steerage, where economy passengers traveled together. Their bustling social activities are contained by elements of naval architecture. Years later, Stieglitz’s friend Max Weber recognized how the fragmented, flattened space and abstract design of this image embodied the tenets of Cubism. The Steerage appeared in Camera Work in 1911, but this enlarged print on Japanese paper was made for the new arts magazine of 291, meant to redirect attention back to the Photo-secession.",

When Rodchenko photographed the academy, however, he concentrated on this adjacent dormitory, built on the academy ground after the Revolution. In this Modernist high-rise block, students, faculty and administrators occupied identical apartments. The artist used the building’s geometry as an arresting graphic design element.",

When he became involved with the Civil Rights Movement as a college student, he was appointed staff photographer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1967 the photographer was permitted to take his camera into the prisons of Texas, where he made many friends among the inmates over the fourteen-month project. This image is one from a sequence depicting a team preparing the fields for planting on a prison farm in East Texas. White uniforms protect them from the sun as they hoe in unison.

She covered the European Theater during World War II and became the first woman photographer accredited to the United States Air Force. In 1943 LIFE editors sent her to Gary, to investigate women who had taken industrial jobs in place of men drafted into the service. In this photograph for the magazine, they work as a team with military precision. Contemporary with Bourke-White’s photographs of the welders, the popular song “Rosie the Riveter,” by the Four Vagabonds became a hit, with its chorus: “All the day long / Whether rain or shine, / She’s a part of the assembly line. / She’s making history, / Working for victory: / Rosie . . . the Riveter.” Bourke-White went on to photograph some of the era’s most influential people for LIFE, from Joseph Stalin, to Pope Pius XI, and Mahatma Gandhi.",

Morris studied literature in college, then in 1933 he trekked through Europe with a camera to photograph his adventures. In the 1940s Morris combined his photographs with excerpts of original prose “phototexts,” interdependent works of art for exhibition. Some of these projects were published as books, including The Home Place, of 1948. Taken for the project, this photograph of the humble train station at Panama conveys the isolation of the prairie, and evokes Morris’s childhood memories.

Every day he went out onto the streets of Manhattan and shot candid 35-mm Kodachrome slides of his fellow New Yorkers. In the darkroom he methodically studied the limitations of chromogenic printing. Meyerowitz bought an old 8 x 10-inch view camera in 1976. It demanded a slower rhythm, and its expensive film caused the photographer to focus on static images without figures. In Vivian’s Things, Meyerowitz used his large camera to investigate light, space and color. Bright seaside light pours into the bedroom of a rented Cape Cod beach house. The reflections from different angles in glass surfaces around the room provide a complex view of the small space. Meyerowitz arranged a riot of colors and patterns reminiscent of the work of Les Nabis, the young Parisian painters of the 1890s—like Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard—who combined the bright colors of Impressionism with compositional distortion.",

In 1904 the commission for a series of portraits took Coburn to London. He explored the city with his camera, photographing views influenced by the work of James McNeill Whistler and Paul Cézanne. Over five years he accumulated images that he transformed into photogravure, etching and printing the plates himself. This plate from Coburn’s London series reflects his shift from the aesthetics of Pictorialism to Modernism.

Sugimoto’s photographs of displays at the American Museum of Natural History, with their taxidermy mounts in fictive natural habitats, confronted themes of creativity, perception, and time. This image from Sugimoto’s Theaters series grapples with similar issues. To photograph the lavish decor of 1920s American movie palaces, he set up his view camera under the projection booth in each deserted auditorium. He set the timer for the length of a feature film, and ran the movie. The individual frames of the film canceled each other to create a searing white light on screen, illuminating the empty interior. In this way, Sugimoto photographed the opulent room, the duration of the film, and the passage of time.",

In 1930, however, he was stricken with tuberculosis and moved to the American Southwest, where he met and married the painter Gina Schnaufer. They settled in Tesuque, north of Santa Fe, and began a family. Knee explored the countryside, photographing the Spanish colonial churches of the region. This chapel at La Manga is a private shrine. It was built in 1932 by David Ortega and his neighbors in gratitude for his brother’s recovery from an illness. Knee’s image captures the humble but much-loved sanctuary, glorified by nature with a bright Southwestern sky and a magnificent bank of cumulus clouds.",

The scheme was promoted by alderman Sidney Story and the district came to be known as Storyville. Twenty-five-year old Ernest J. Belloc had then been a New Orleans photographer for several years. He was comfortable in Storyville, blocks from where he had grown up, and he photographed in its gaming rooms, opium dens and bordellos. This is one of a series of intimate portraits of women, thought to be Storyville prostitutes. The familiarity of these images has prompted speculation that Bellocq was a brothel habitué and that photographs reveal friendships with the women. This is a recent print from a group of negatives, discovered in 1967, that prompted much creative fantasy about the photographer and his life.",

Frank photographed consumers who seem obsessed with these products, but unaware of each other. These marchers gathering before the New York St. Patrick’s Day parade presents a similar alienation. Most of the celebrants appear unaware; only one little girl looks at the photographer. They congregate before a banner proclaiming County Derry as their home.

To illuminate supersonic exposures, he engineered lightbulbs filled with argon, and then xenon, that could produce 60 flashes of light per second. In order to demonstrate his stroboscopic lighting systems and envision their broad scientific applications, Edgerton made experimental photographs in the laboratory, often of sports subjects. He recruited Fesler, the Big Ten MVP of 1930 to kick a football in the studio. This split-second exposure reveals the unexpected physics of the event. Fesler’s boot sinks deep into the ball with the force of the kick. A layer of dust dislodged from the ball’s top seam is captured in mid-air.",

He was also a protégé of Clarence White, and while still a student, Struss developed and patented a soft-focus camera lens for the fashionable Pictorialist style. For this vacation photograph of his sister Hilda, he used a long lens that enabled him to compose in the camera. Struss stood in the shade of a leafy tree and pointed his camera toward the setting sun. He simplified the image into flat, component forms arranged to draw the viewer in. After World War I, Struss moved to Los Angeles and became a silent film cameraman, working with Cecil B. DeMille. In 1927 he shared the first Academy Award for cinematography.",

But it was combatants who took most photographs of the war. This stereograph of the Battle of Passchendaele was probably taken by a foot soldier. In World War I armies dug into the earth to protect themselves from enemy fire. To gain ground they climbed to the surface and charged on foot, facing a defensive barrage and severe casualties. This stereograph of Scottish soldiers relaxing in their trenches suggests this process, and reveals the devastation of the countryside near Ypres in Belgium. Its two images were taken simultaneously with a camera with two lenses. When viewed with a device that held the photograph centered on the face, before the focal plane, they combine to create a sense of depth and dimension. This was an old-fashioned entertainment, revived by the war for its descriptive intensity.",

Morell had turned the room into a camera obscura, and students who had always taken the camera for granted suddenly understood its function. He later traveled around the world setting up cameras obscura and photographing inside them. He captured skyscrapers in New York, the Uffizi in Florence, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and many other places, projected on the walls of nearby hotel rooms. As a fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy, Morell made this camera obscura photograph in a private home.

In 1907 Auguste and Louis Lumière—later pioneers of cinema—introduced color glass plates to the market, sized to standard cameras. The plates were prepared with a layer of microscopic grains of potato starch, dyed red, green, and blue, covered by a panchromatic silver halide emulsion. When exposed in the camera, the minuscule spots of color acted as a mosaic filter for complementary hues, creating a negative image. The plate was reverse-processed as a positive color transparency. The military photographer Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud was a friend of the Lumière Brothers, and one of the first to embrace the Autochrome technique. At the end of World War I he made color propaganda images of the Armistice, the Paris peace talks and negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles.",

Muray had studied the printing arts in his native Hungary, and had the technical knowledge to pursue the color process of carbro printing. The process begins when three negatives of the same image are exposed through red, blue and green filters. The resulting gelatin silver bromide prints were chemically transformed into low-relief images of pigmented carbon on transfer paper. When precisely superimposed, these made up full color images on paper. Muray understood further how to transfer these to zinc plates for mass printing. This photograph exemplifies the high-key color preferred for printed reproduction in the 1930s-50s. Its cut-and-paste design and manipulated scale emphasize the advertised products.",

He organized shoots at recognizable locations in Paris and Rome, but also to farms, circuses, and the launch pads of Cape Canaveral. While his fashion and commercial work projected unusual elegance, his portraits revealed surprising aspects of character. Avedon was a great admirer of the great French film director Jean Renoir’s work, and delighted in 1972 to visit him in Beverly Hills. His home was like the South of France, filled with daylight and fresh flowers. The elderly Renoir was ailing and frail, and Avedon worked sensitively to capture a likeness of visual simplicity and psychological complexity. In its full-face bust before a white background, this image typifies Avedon’s portraits work at the time. He concentrated on expression with an asymmetrical visage reflecting a number of different expressions at once.",

To capture unfamiliar qualities of his celebrity sitters, he arranged two vertical flats in his studio and placed them inside the variable niche. “This confinement seemed to comfort people, soothing them,” Penn wrote. “The walls were a surface to lean on or push against. For me the picture possibilities were interesting, limiting the subjects’ movement seemed to relieve me of part of the problem of holding on to them.” Marcel Duchamp was among many who posed for full-length portraits in Penn’s corner. During the 1910s this artist challenged the very definition of creativity by selecting common, mass-produced objects and presented these “readymades” as works of fine art. By 1948 Duchamp had become indispensable in the art circles of both Paris and New York art circles, but claimed to have abandoned art for chess.",

Born and raised in Brooklyn, he was drafted into the Army in 1942, and became a squad leader in the 415th Infantry Regiment, the Timberwolves, a unit trained for night fighting. Late in 1944 the regiment was involved in the bloody Battle of the Scheldt, for which Jaffee and other regiment members were awarded the Bronze Star. Back in Brooklyn, he struggled with post traumatic stress disorder. Photography helped him concentrate, connect with people, and express his feelings. Some of Jaffee’s street photographs convey despondency and dread. Other images demonstrate his acute perception, his skill at capturing a powerful moment, and his gift for storytelling. Jaffee was particularly sensitive to the expressive quality of posture. Even when photographing people from the back he could capture a relationship of affection and trust.",

He built a freelance career on sensational images that he could sell to tabloid newspapers and true-crime magazines. His methods prefigured the celebrity paparazzi of the 1950s, and his style contributed to the cinematic style of film noir. Weegee monitored the teletype—and later the police radio—and usually arrived first for urgent events around the city. He used a flash to shoot high-contrast images calculated for the heavy newspaper inking of tabloid presses. To get his photographs to the newspapers first, Weegee often developed his negatives in a makeshift darkroom in the trunk of his 1928 Ford sedan. He had a knack for ironic images, and those with a cruel twist. Typical of Weegee’s work of the late 1930s, Tire Inspection is the image of a homeless panhandler, rubbing his feet as he settles for the night on a Hell’s Kitchen pavement.",

Uelsmann experimented with different ways of combining their details in fantastic images influenced by Surrealism. He collected his own repertoire of original negatives, including thousands of images of landscapes, architecture, figures and foliage. In 1967 he outfitted a darkroom with seven enlargers that enabled him to align his negatives into one composite print. In this broad panoramic landscape the laws of physics seem no longer to apply. A leafy tree with its roots unfurled hovers above an island in a mountain lake. The island itself is airborne, and its underside is reflected in the glassy water. Close examination shows how Uelsmann created the background and floating island is a mirror image.",

Erwitt was a set photographer for Hollywood films like On the Waterfront and The Seven Year Itch. But dogs remained his favorite subject, and he has observed their personalities and exploits and around the world. “It’s simple,” Erwitt said. “I like dogs. They’re nice and they don’t ask for prints.” This unposed image of rural partners reflects his ability to encapsulate a complex relationship in a single, endearing image.

He took his camera to uncommon places, and made candid exposures that helped viewers to recognize the miraculous in the commonplace. This unusual view from inside the mezzanine level of the Eiffel Tower exemplifies the originality of Kertész’s vision. The portability of the miniature camera, and its fast exposure, enabled him to crouch, reach and lean, stretching his body to position the camera at odd angles for a fresh viewpoint. Kertész often shot multiple views of a single subject, and his sequencing of images were unprecedented in photojournalism. In the mid-1930s he associated with the Surrealists, and his photographs appeared in the magazines Bifur, Variétés and Minotaure.",

Aside from their place in society, Arbus was interested in their personalities and intimate relationships.

Although he created soft-focus images in the 1910s, in 1923-26 when he worked in Mexico, the tropical sunshine and arid atmosphere led him to a style of sharp focus and precision. Weston exploited the limits of photographic technology, simultaneously to convey sculptural form and surface texture. This is apparent in this image of model Charis Wilson. Carefully framing the figure, Weston accentuated its sinuous outlines and plastic form. Most remarkable in its time, however, was the way that this photograph depicted texture, from the smooth contours of flesh to the granularity of sand.",
