## <a name="searching"></a>Searching
The basic search bar appears in the main navigation menu throughout the site and can be used for broad keyword searches. Users can search for a particular artist, date, historical event, or other keywords. The site’s search engine will return items related to the term(s) entered, regardless of where it appears in the record of an item.

Users can also leverage search filters and facets located on the left side of the results page. Selecting a facet will narrow search results. Selected filters are displayed under the main search bar. Users can remove a selected filter by clicking the “x” icon located next to the filter flag.

## Digitization Information

Materials have been photographed or digitally scanned to the highest quality possible. In some cases, images have limitations on zooming and downloading, due to copyright restrictions.

If you have additional materials you would like to be considered for digitization and uploaded to the Marble platform, please reach out to the appropriate partner(s):

* Snite Museum of Art: [Registrar (Victoria Perdomo)](mailto:vperdomo@nd.edu)
* Hesburgh Libraries: [Consult a subject librarian](https://resources.library.nd.edu/documents/librarians-guide.pdf)

Please note: The consideration and approval of digitization requests for Marble depend on a number of factors, including the size of the proposed collection; the physical condition of the proposed collection; and current or upcoming digitization work. If you are interested in starting or advocating for a digitization project, we encourage you to initiate the process as soon as possible.
