## Disclaimer
This site is a gateway to a selection of the publicly accessible research collections stewarded by the Hesburgh Libraries and Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame. We invite you to explore our cultural heritage holdings.

We have a shared commitment to the preservation and dissemination of information and knowledge for study across time. Through the digitization of our collections and dissemination of descriptive information, we strive to enable global discovery and open access to holdings.

We aim to describe and display materials online in a way that is inclusive and respectful, and does not cause distress to those who interact with our collections. However, we acknowledge that historical descriptions may contain language that is racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, or otherwise harmful. We also acknowledge that some of our collection items themselves are products of their particular time and may contain offensive language, negative stereotypes, or other graphic materials. While historical images and original descriptive data are preserved to facilitate research, library and museum curators continually work to address harmful or offensive language and add additional context as part of their descriptive work.

We invite the community to help us identify and address these issues by using the “Feedback” button visible throughout the site. Library and museum staff will review feedback and update content in a way that balances the preservation of original context with more inclusive language to enable all of us to engage in more truthful conversations about the history and significance of our collections.

## Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Marble Digital Collections website. The site is maintained by the University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries and the Snite Museum of Art.
### 1. What information do we collect?
Depending on how you interact with the Marble site, we may collect personal information, such as your name or email address. We use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the University of Notre Dame network. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous.

If you decide to create a user account or log in through your University of Notre Dame credentials, we store the information you provide in order to ensure the functionality of the personalized portfolio feature. We also store the personalized portfolios and annotations that you create as part of this feature. Users have complete control over when, if at all, the portfolios are shared.
### 2. How do we use this information?
The University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries website staff uses the above information to generate aggregate site reports that help us improve our site architecture and content to better meet user needs and to support the user-created portfolio feature. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. Web server logs are retained in AWS on a temporary basis (10 years) and then deleted completely from our systems.

We use the account (ie. email address, user name) and portfolio information that you provide to enable repeated access to the personalized portfolios. At any time, you can delete portfolios from your account and you you can contact us directly with the feedback form at the bottom of the page to delete your account on the Marble site.

We use the information mentioned above within the Hesburgh Libraries IT team to improve and maintain important services. At no time, however, do we share your account information with third parties; your portfolios, if made publicly available, may be tracked and indexed by Google and other search engines.
### 3. What security measures do you have in place to keep my information safe?
The University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
### 4. Who should I contact with questions about this policy or the security of my information?
