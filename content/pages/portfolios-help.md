## What is a portfolio?
The Portfolio tool turns members of the Notre Dame community into curators, allowing each person to create customized lists and collections of content. Users browse, search, and easily save items of interest into portfolios for future viewing.

* Portfolios allow you to bring digitized items from across campus together in new and different ways.
* They can be used to develop course materials or advance individual scholarship.
* Annotations can be made on individual items throughout the site to help you organize and document insights at any time.
* And, you have control over viewing preferences — portfolios can stay private for individual use or be shared with students, campus peers, or the public.

Note: You must have Notre Dame credentials to create portfolios. Please be prepared to log in with your NetID.

STEP 3: Set up your portfolio.
