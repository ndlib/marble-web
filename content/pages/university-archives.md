The [University Archives](https://archives.nd.edu) collects, preserves, and makes accessible the official records of the University of Notre Dame. This historically valuable material documents the academic and administrative responsibilities of the University as well as the experiences of its students, alumni, officers, faculty, staff, and benefactors. The Archives also collects and maintains records, papers, photographs, printed material, and audio-visual material that document the life of the Catholic Church and her people as lived in the American context, and is recognized as one of the nation's foremost archival repositories for the study of American Catholicism.
