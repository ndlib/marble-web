However, we acknowledge that historical desciptions may contain language that is racist, sexist, colonialist, homophobic, or otherwise harmful. We also acknowledge that some of our collection items themselves are products of their particular time and may contain offensive language, negative stereotypes, or other graphic materials. While historical images and original descriptive data are preserved to facilitate research, library and museum curators continually work to address harmful or offensive language and add additional context as part of their descriptive work.</p> <p>We invite the community to help us identify and address these issues by using the “Feedback” button visible throughout the site.
